Pika Voice Assistant - Project Description
Pika is your personal "potato Jarvis" voice assistant built in Python! Here's what it does:
---Main Purpose
Pika recognizes your voice commands and can interact with text editors (specifically Notepad) to write and read text for you. It's like having a simple AI assistant that listens to you and helps with basic text tasks.
--- How It Works
Core Components:
Speech Recognition - Uses your microphone to listen and convert your speech to text
Text-to-Speech - Speaks back to you with a synthesized voice
Notepad Integration - Can control Notepad to write and read text
Voice Command Processing - Understands specific commands and responds accordingly
Technical Stack:
Python 3.11 - Main programming language
SpeechRecognition - Converts speech to text using Google's API
pyttsx3 - Converts text to speech (offline)
pyautogui - Controls keyboard/mouse to interact with Notepad
subprocess - Manages opening applications like Notepad
---What Pika Can Do
Command	What Happens
"Write this: [your text]"	Opens Notepad and types your text
"Read"	Reads aloud whatever text is in Notepad
"Open Notepad"	Launches the Notepad application
"Hello" / "Hi"	Greets you back
"Exit" / "Quit" / "Goodbye"	Stops the assistant
 How the Voice Recognition Works
Listens continuously through your microphone
Processes audio and sends it to Google's speech recognition service
Converts speech to text
Analyzes the text for known commands
Executes the appropriate action
Responds with voice feedback
--- Cool Features
Real-time voice processing - Responds immediately to your commands
Error handling - Tells you if it didn't understand or if there's no internet
Clipboard integration - Can read text from Notepad by copying it
Background process detection - Knows if Notepad is already running
Graceful shutdown - Can be stopped with voice commands or Ctrl+C
---Future Expansion Ideas
More text editors support
File operations (save, open files)
Web searches
Weather information
Calculator functions
Email sending
And much more
